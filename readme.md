<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a Spider-Man: No Way <i>Homeage</i> personal portfolio website I built to demonstrate the skills I have acquired in front end web development & design and my love for superheros! It was built with semantic HTML5, CSS (Using Bootstrap and CSS Flexbox), Javascript, and Particles.js. It is currently hosted live online at <a href="https://www.captivatingwebsite.com/">www.captivatingwebsite.com</a> so that people who would like to hire me for web development can learn about me, and have several different ways to contact me. The contact form currently works using Netlify Forms, but will not work on a development server. The project can easily be hosted on your machine by cloning the repo and running the website using Live Server or by using npm to run a localhost port on your machine.

<h3>The features I have built into the page for CSS are:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Using css animations to make the items in the Abilities section pulse when they are hovered over.</li>
  <li>Using css animations to make the items in the Abilities section wiggle back and forth.</li>
  <li>Using :nth-child to style the hamburger menu.</li>
  <li>Using css animations to turn the hamburger menu into an "X" when the menu is open, and back to a hamburger when closed.</li>
  <li>Using flex order to move my picture to the top of the About section when the screen size is for a mobile device.</li>
  <li>Hiding the mobile navigation when the hamburger is not "clicked".</li>
  <li>And many more!</li>
</ol>

<h3>The features I have built into the page for JavaScript are:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>A fixed navigation bar that scrolls down with the page on desktop.</li>
  <li>A mobile menu that pops out with the hamburger icon is clicked on a tablet or smaller device.</li>
  <li>A script that checks if the user is in darkmode browser to serve the favicon that will be seen better.</li>
  <li>An interactive particle header that I did a few javascript adjustments for to have it resemble a spiderweb</li>
</ol>

I hope you enjoy!
