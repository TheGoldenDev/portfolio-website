<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a Spider-Man: No Way <i>Homeage</i> personal portfolio website I built to demonstrate the skills I have acquired in front end web development & design, and my love for superheros! It was built with HTML, CSS (Using Bootstrap and CSS Flexbox), Javascript, PHP, and Particles.js. The website is online at <a href="https://www.captivatingwebsite.com/">www.captivatingwebsite.com</a> so people interested in hiring me for web development can learn about me, see my experience, and contact me. The contact form currently works using Netlify Forms, but will not work on a development server. You can view my project online at the url link above or locally by cloning the repo and running the website using the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code or with npm by running a localhost port on your machine.


<h3>JavaScript Project Features:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I created a form that saves the values (on click of Submit button) to an external .txt file using PHP and JavaScript and prompts a download for the file while also sending an email via AJAX. Find this code. This code is in contact.php and line 114 in main.js</li>
  <li>I implemented a regular expression to check if the email is properly formatted before accepting a form submit. Contact fields also include conditional logic to check for empty fields, prevent them from being submitted, and then display a notification message to the form user in HTML. Find the code on lines 57 - 138 in main.js</li>
  <li>My portfolio section had most of it's static HTML replaced with JS generated elements that utilize a whole lot of variables, loops, and functions! Find most of this code in projects.js. It is also imported into main.js and my project array is in project-list.js.</li>
</ol>

I hope you enjoy!
